## Calculator

A simple calculator written in
- React 16
- Typescript 3.5.1
- Development server provided by `create-react-app` running on node 10.15.1

### Known issues
- Length of characters allowed is not restricted and longer values break the UI.
- I have tested most functionality but not to the depth I would usually like.
    - No E2E tests
    - Unit tests are simple
    - Acceptance tests are simple
    
### If I had longer I would...
- Limit length to 9 characters
- Expand tests to include some more complex calculations
- Expand on the logic to use a functional composition model to build up a calculation.
